        <p className="mt-8 leading-7">Welcome to our Privacy Policy Your privacy is critically important to us.
          It is LUNAR SMS’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website. This Privacy Policy applies to <Link to="http://Lunarsms.com" className="text-[#13A541]">http://Lunarsms.com</Link> (hereinafter, "us", "we", or “<Link to="http://Lunarsms.com" className="text-[#13A541]">http://Lunarsms.com</Link>"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting personally identifiable information you may provide us through the website. This Privacy Policy outlines what information may be collected on our website, how we use this information, and under what circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties. This Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect through the website and does not apply to our collection of information from other sources.
          This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms and Conditions posted on our website, set forth the general rules and policies governing your use of our website. Depending on your activities when visiting our website, you may be required to agree to additional terms and conditions.
        </p>

        <h1 className="text-3xl mt-7 font-semibold">Website Visitors</h1>
        <p className="mt-2 leading-7">
          Like most website operators, LUNAR SMS collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. LUNAR SMS’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how our visitors use the website. From time to time, LUNAR SMS may release non-personally-identifying information in aggregate, such as publishing a report on website usage trends.
          LUNAR SMS also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged-in users and for users leaving comments. LUNAR SMS only discloses logged-in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.
        </p>

        <h1 className="text-3xl mt-7 font-semibold">Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h1>
        <p className="mt-2 leading-7">
          Certain visitors to LUNAR SMS’s website choose to interact with us in ways that require the collection of personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information gathered depend on the nature of the interaction. For instance, we ask visitors who sign up for a newsletter to provide a username and email address.
        </p>

        <h1 className="text-3xl mt-7 font-semibold">Security</h1>
        <p className="mt-2 leading-7">
          The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee absolute security.
        </p>

        <h1 className="text-3xl mt-7 font-semibold">Advertisements</h1>
        <p className="mt-2 leading-7">
          Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by LUNAR SMS and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
        </p>

        <h1 className="text-3xl mt-7 font-semibold">Links to External Sites</h1>

        <h1 className="text-3xl mt-7 font-semibold">Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h1>
        <p className="mt-2 leading-7">
          LUNAR SMS discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information to process it on our behalf or to provide services available at LUNAR SMS’s website, and (ii) have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of these parties may be located outside your home country; by using our website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. LUNAR SMS will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone.
          Other than to its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations, as described above, LUNAR SMS discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order, or other governmental request, or when LUNAR SMS believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of LUNAR SMS, third parties, or the public at large.

          If you are a registered user of <Link to="http://Lunarsms.com" className="text-[#13A541]">http://Lunarsms.com</Link> and have supplied your email address, LUNAR SMS may occasionally send you an email to inform you about new features, solicit your feedback, or keep you up to date with what’s happening with LUNAR SMS and our products. We primarily use our blog for this type of information, so we expect to keep such emails to a minimum. If you send us a request (e.g., via a support email or feedback mechanism), we reserve the right to publish it to clarify or respond to your request or to support other users. LUNAR SMS takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
